Backend:
Python (Flask-SocketIO)
Flask
WebSocketServer (Custom Wrapper)

How It Works
1. Server Side (server.py)
A Flask app is initialized using WebSocketServer.

Handles three WebSocket events:

connect: Logs when a user connects.

disconnect: Logs when a user disconnects.

message: Receives a message (with username and text), attaches a timestamp, and broadcasts it to all connected clients.

2. Frontend Components
SimpleMessageInput.tsx:
Users input their username and type a message. Messages are sent via WebSocket when clicking the button or pressing Enter.

SimpleChatBody.tsx:
Displays all incoming messages. Users can filter messages by username using a search bar.
